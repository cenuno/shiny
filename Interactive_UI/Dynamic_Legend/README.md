# Overview

This Shiny app updates a Leaflet map's legend based on which layer - socioeconomic variable - the user selects on the top right of the map.

# Structure

* `global.R`: import, filter, and create objects to be used in `server.R`.
* `ui.R`: create the user-interface and objects to be used in `server.R`.
* `server.R`: performs a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user<sup>1</sup>.
