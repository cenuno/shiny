This Shiny app updates a Leaflet map's legend based on which layer - socioeconomic variable - the user selects on the top right of the map. 

# Run App

Run the app yourself using the following lines of code:

```R
# install CRAN packages
install.packages( pkgs = c( "devtools", magrittr", "shiny"
                            , "sp", "stringr", "rgdal"
                            )
                    )
                    
# install developmental `leaflet` package from GitHub
devtools::install_github( "rstudio/leaflet" )

# load the shiny package
library( shiny )

# Run shiny app from your R/RStudio Console
shiny::runUrl( url = "https://github.com/cenuno/shiny/archive/master.zip"
                , subdir = "Dynamic_Legend"
                )
