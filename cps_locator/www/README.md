## Introduction

This folder stores the .css file that styles the `cps_locator` Shiny app.

## Background
On May 6, 2014, RStudio published [*Style your apps with CSS*](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html), a helpful guide on customizing the color and style of [Shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) using [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)(Cascading Style Sheets). 

CSS controls how [HMTL](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)(Hyper Markup Text Language) are displayed on the screen.

### Directions
The post gives the following directions:

> You can apply a CSS file to your entire Shiny app by linking to it from within your Shiny App.
> * Create a subdirectory named `www` in your Shiny app directory. This subdirectory name `www` is special. Shiny makes every file in `www` available to your user’s browser. The `www` subdirectory is a great place to put CSS files, images, and other things a browser needs to build your Shiny App.
> * Place your CSS file in the www subdirectory.
